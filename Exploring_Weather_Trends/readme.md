# Exploring weather trends
I extracted the data from the temperatures database, then downloaded the results to a CSV. I analyze tokyo and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends.


## Database Schema
There are three tables in the database:

- city_list - This contains a list of cities and countries in the database. Look through them in order to find the city nearest to you.
- city_data - This contains the average temperatures for each city by year (ºC).
- global_data - This contains the average global temperatures by year (ºC).
